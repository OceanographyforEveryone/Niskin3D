Niskin3D
========

### Background

Niskin3D is low-cost, open-source water sampler made from 3D-printed parts and controlled by a waterproof servo. 

### Overview

The Niskin bottle, a seemingly simple tube designed to take water samples at discrete depths, is one of the most important tools of oceanography. Coupled with a CTD, an array of Niskin bottles fit into a rosette provides everything an oceanographer needs to profile the ocean. Niskin bottles are neither cheap nor particularly easy to use. A commercial rosette requires a winch to launch and recover, requiring both a vessel and a crew to deploy. For informal, unaffiliated, or unfunded researchers, as well as citizen scientists or any researcher working on a tight budget, getting high-quality, discrete water samples is an ongoing challenge. 

The Niskin3D lowers the cost of discrete-depth water sampling and makes this common tool of oceanographic research available to anyone. 

### Current Status

Undergoing major redesign as of 2/12/2019.

### Bill of Materials

We use Amazon Affiliate links because the small kickback helps fund more projects like this, but almost everything can be sourced through hobby shops, hardware stores, and other retailers. These recommendations don't necessarily represent the cheapest pricesbut rather the actual components I bought for this project. Other high-test line and elestics can be used in place of the monofilament and sligshot tubing.
