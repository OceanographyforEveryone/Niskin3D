Niskin3D
========

### Background

Niskin3D is low-cost, open-source water sampler made from 3D-printed parts and controlled by a waterproof servo. 

### Overview

The Niskin bottle, a seemingly simple tube designed to take water samples at discrete depths, is one of the most important tools of oceanography. Coupled with a CTD, an array of Niskin bottles fit into a rosette provides everything an oceanographer needs to profile the ocean. Niskin bottles are neither cheap nor particularly easy to use. A commercial rosette requires a winch to launch and recover, requiring both a vessel and a crew to deploy. For informal, unaffiliated, or unfunded researchers, as well as citizen scientists or any researcher working on a tight budget, getting high-quality, discrete water samples is an ongoing challenge. 

The Niskin3D lowers the cost of discrete-depth water sampling and makes this common tool of oceanographic research available to anyone. 

### Current Status
